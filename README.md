## About the App

Complement is an app that recommends complimentary colors for your outfit. Users can upload an image, and receive a collection of complimentary colors to add to that outfit.

### User Stories

- Ken can't decide what to decide to wear to an upcoming event. He knows he wants to wear his favorite blue shirt. However, he has no idea what goes well with it. Stylistically challenged, Ken decides to use Complement to get complementary colors for potential outfits. He goes to the event, receives many compliments.

- Karen is an interior designer. She see's a room and knows she wants to add accents to the curtains and other part of it. She takes a picture of the room, and using Complement's intelligent algorithm she receives a variety of different color options. The room is vivacious, the client gives her many compliments.

- Carlo is working on his car. He's more of a nuts and bolts guy, but wants to work on the interior. He snaps a photo of his car's interior, and uses Complement to find a spectrum of colors that shifts his design to a higher gear. Carlo now has the perfect color for his stitching accents, his wife is pleased, and pays him many compliments.

## API

We decided to use The Color API which gives you options of colors to output given an input color in either hex or rgb format. The options were:
*monochrome
*monochrome-dark
*monochrome-light
*analogic
*complement
*analogic-complement
*triad
*quad
We decided that allowing the user to select between these would be perfect.
